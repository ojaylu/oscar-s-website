            <h3>My Story</h3>
            <p>Most people see computers as merely a tool, while those who study computing are intrigued to know about how they work. I have always been inquisitive, wanting to understand the theory behind computers and the methodology of how they work.
            <p>As a typical teenager, I spent a lot of time playing computer games. Having restrictions on the time I was allowed to game allowed me to develop a new hobby and I started devoting my free time to programming. I started exploring the field of programming through learning applications such as Unity and Python, slowly developing an interest in Computer Science.</p>
            <p>I believe that we are living in an era where programming is an essential skill and impacts many different industries. Computer Science is at the forefront of breakthroughs in all of the modern inventions and we depend on network connections between computers to live and work. Computer Science requires a deep understanding in mathematics, physics and logical thinking.</p>
            <p>I realised that I wanted a career in Computer Science but this was going to be difficult for me in Hong Kong due to subject choice. Continuing my schooling in New Zealand allowed me to develop my interest in Computer Science and I chose to study computer studies, statistics, calculus and physics in Year 13. During my time studying computer studies, I have learnt applications such as Python and Microsoft Database which has greatly broadened my knowledge on programming. Both applications require strong abstract thinking and persistence in spite of facing countless coding errors. By studying Computer Studies I have gained a better insight into this field of study and I have developed self-discipline and persistence.</p>
            <p>As a student, I understand the needs to be a successful learner. I am organised and I have developed effective time management skills. I am capable of independent research to expand my knowledge. I have learnt to strike a balance between studying and other interests and I know this will be important at university. I enjoy sport and I am keen to join the soccer team, and run and swim competitively. I am outgoing, energetic and committed to training schedules. Sport has also taught me the value of being part of a team and the importance of good communication.</p>
            <p>I enjoy taking on leadership roles and in the schools I attended in Hong Kong I was the Chairperson of the Sports Club and the leader of the athletic and swimming team. At Nelson College, I am a Prefect and part of the Year 13 leadership programme where I mentor younger students. From these roles I have developed confidence and learnt to take responsibility for my own actions and the importance of effective communication.</p>
            <p>In addition to my school studies, I have taken part in the STAR course provided by the University of Canterbury where I was able to delve deeper into the world of advanced maths and advance my problem solving skills.</p>
            <p>Studying abroad was not easy, but knowing that I’m studying in the same school as Lord Rutherford, the father of nuclear physics has motivated me to achieve Excellence. From this experience I have acquired the skills to be self-reliant and independent. My choice for wanting to come back to Hong Kong to further pursue my studies relates to my future aspirations. In addition, I have also missed my home, family and the culture of Hong Kong and thus, I look forward to having the privilege to study for a Bachelor in Engineering at your university.</p>
            <p>As Henry Ford once said, “failure is simply an opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently”. About a year ago, I faced my greatest setback as I had a meniscus tear. This was a very challenging time for me personally, however, I managed to climb back up, and from that incident I have learnt resilience and perseverance. I have a strong work ethic and I am proud of my achievements, excelling in all the subjects I study. As such, I have gained over a hundred Level 3 Excellence credits and an A+ in the STAR university mathematics  course.</p>
            <p>My future aspirations are to gain a Bachelor in Engineering (Computer Science) and pursue a career in Engineering, with the goal of starting my own business in Hong Kong.</p>
